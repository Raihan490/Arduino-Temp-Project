🌡️ Arduino Temperature-Controlled Smart Fan

This project is a simple smart-home prototype that automatically turns on a fan when the temperature gets too high. A DHT11 sensor reads the room temperature, and when it reaches 40°C, the Arduino activates the fan on its own. This helps save energy by only running the fan when it’s actually needed.

By building this project, I learned how sensors and automation work together to create smarter and more efficient devices—similar to the systems used in modern homes and weather stations.
